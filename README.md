This is a quick and dirty port of "LIFX Android SDK" to Java. It is almost the exact same code as the Android SDK, with the addition of an implementation of the android packages. So the API is the same, making it easy to change to the official version when LIFX releases the Java SDK. See more details at https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-sdk-android
